# Intelliship Quote Automation System (Repo Index)

Welcome to the full-stack quoting automation ecosystem designed by Intelliship.
This modular, CLI-driven system simulates how a freight organization can reduce
quote turnaround time from **2+ hours** to **under 10 minutes** for live RFQs,
and under 30 minutes for raw intake-to-decision scenarios.

Each repo is composable, documented, and versioned for enterprise evolution.
