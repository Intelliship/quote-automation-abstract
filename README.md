# Quote Automation System – Abstract Logic Repository

This repository contains abstracted logic and modular components from a production-grade quote automation system. It is designed to reduce friction, standardize responses, and surface risk proactively.

## Objective

Reduce freight quote turnaround from 2+ hours to under 30 minutes using structured logic, reusable templates, and smart scoring engines.

## Structure

```
rfq_clusters/       – YAML objects grouped by scenario type (e.g., imports, transloads, project cargo)
quote_templates/    – Customer-facing draft responses by condition
logic_modules/      – Scoring, SLA triggers, quote path logic
accessorials/       – Detention, FSC, permit fee references
```

## Usage

This abstract system transforms raw RFQ inputs into automated quote logic, enabling teams to execute faster with fewer errors. Designed to plug into any internal quoting workflow while remaining data-agnostic and platform-agnostic.
