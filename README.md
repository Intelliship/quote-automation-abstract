# Quote Automation System – Abstract Logic Repository

A structured quote lifecycle automation system abstracted from real-world logistics workflows. Built to reduce turnaround time, enforce consistency, and enable platform-scale quoting across enterprise operations.

## Objective

Reduce quote turnaround time from 4+ hours to under 30 minutes using structured logic objects, reusable templates, and automated risk scoring.

## Structure

- `rfq_clusters/` – YAML-based logic objects per customer/project (e.g., Vestas, Tera9, Siemens)
- `quote_templates/` – Prewritten customer responses based on quoting scenarios
- `logic_modules/` – Risk scoring, decision rules, and SLA-based logic triggers
- `accessorials/` – Master cost tables for detention, fuel surcharge, permits, etc.

## Usage

This repository consumes raw inputs from `quote-automation-raw/` and transforms them into structured, automated logic for quoting execution and internal ops workflows.
