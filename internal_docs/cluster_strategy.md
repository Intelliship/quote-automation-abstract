# ðŸ§  Cluster Strategy: FPT, Inverse FPT, and SET Analysis

## Overview

This internal document captures the foundational thinking behind our RFQ cluster system. It explains how we design modular quote logic using:

- **First Principles Thinking (FPT)**
- **Inverse First Principles Thinking**
- **Structural Emergence Theory (SET)**

Only ~2% of the data in an RFQ survives. These clusters focus on that critical 2%â€”the irreducible variables that determine quote logic, speed, and conversion.

## âœ… Deployed Cluster Summaries

### 1. `domestic_project_cluster.yaml`

| Principle | Summary |
|----------|---------|
| **FPT** | Survives via ZIP-pair logic, load count, weight class, and lowboy equipment |
| **Inverse FPT** | Fails if treated as transactional freight or missing escort logic |
| **SET** | Seen in energy, O&G, and industrial project flowsâ€”multi-trailer patterns emerge repeatedly |

---

### 2. `domestic_heavyhaul_cluster.yaml`

| Principle | Summary |
|----------|---------|
| **FPT** | Weight > 105,000 lbs, 4-axle trailers, and oversized permits define quote logic |
| **Inverse FPT** | Risk of underpricing if treated like standard oversize |
| **SET** | Repetition across energy jobs, refineries, and rig zonesâ€”massively weight-dependent moves |

---

### 3. `domestic_drayage_pasadena_cluster.yaml`

| Principle | Summary |
|----------|---------|
| **FPT** | ZIP-to-ZIP logic, chassis requirement, and 40HC equipment |
| **Inverse FPT** | Treating as long-haul or ignoring port congestion leads to delays or penalties |
| **SET** | Pasadena â†’ Houston drayage flows follow a short-haul structural loopâ€”reusable template patterns emerge |

## Key Takeaways

These clusters are not staticâ€”they reflect living, structural patterns in how freight is quoted and awarded. Each cluster increases our systemâ€™s modularity, adaptability, and ability to predict quote outcomes.
