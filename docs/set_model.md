# Structural Emergence Theory (SET)

## 🔍 What is SET?

**Structural Emergence Theory** is a systems engineering principle that says:
> “Structure does not precede observation—it emerges from it.”

Instead of designing rigid frameworks up front, we:
- Trace what users are actually doing
- Observe system reactions
- Capture patterns
- Let structure emerge through feedback

## 🧠 Why It Works

SET adapts better to:
- Evolving workflows
- User exceptions
- Fragmented communication (e.g., email-based quoting)

## 🧩 How We Apply SET in Quote Automation

1. **Capture** raw RFQs and response behavior in `quote-automation-raw`
2. **Cluster** related behaviors into logical `yaml` blocks
3. **Abstract** repeatable elements into templates and logic modules
4. **Respond** by building only what survives real usage

## 💡 SET in Practice

Rather than assume:
> "Our quoting process is 5 steps..."

We ask:
> "What actually happens when 20 RFQs come in chaos-mode?"

The structure that emerges becomes the real process.

## 🔗 Origin

Coined and applied by **Intelliship**, SET underpins every system built for scale and clarity.
